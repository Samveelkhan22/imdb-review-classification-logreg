# IMDB Review Classification with Logistic Regression

This repository contains a classification project using Logistic Regression to determine whether IMDB movie reviews are positive or negative based on their text content.

## üìö **Project Overview**

The classification of movie reviews is a fundamental natural language processing (NLP) task. This project:
- Analyzes a dataset of 50,000 labeled IMDB reviews.
- Preprocesses text data using TF-IDF Vectorization.
- Trains a Logistic Regression model to classify reviews as positive or negative.
- Evaluates performance using metrics such as accuracy, F1-score, and a confusion matrix.
- Conducts fairness analysis to assess prediction equity across demographic groups.
